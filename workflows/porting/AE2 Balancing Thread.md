- Proposal
	- Lock AE2 behind a *custom* late-game ore located in `minecraft:end`
	- Basic machines and storage is still entirely possible, though server-based machines (the center of most of AE2) requires end exploration.
	- This material might also lock the material Enderium from Thermal Expansion (and on a similar note Thermal expansion's previous tier, whatever it's called, should be similarly based on a custom ore in the `minecraft:nether`)
- Requirements
	- See [[Disable End-based origins]]
