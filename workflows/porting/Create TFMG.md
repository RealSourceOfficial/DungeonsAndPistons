- Proposal 1:
	- Use molten steel, in combination with a tetra or tetra-like mod, to do pickaxe autosmelting.
- Proposal 2: 
	- Class pipes by material, add max flow rate, broken state, and pipe explosions.
	- Reason:
		- TFMG adds various pipe materials, and adding a dynamic system of fluids breaking and blowing pipes will discourage the use of a single pipe in a factory.
