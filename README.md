# The ScurvyDogs Unofficial Pack

## 🌍 Adventure, RPG, and Tech Combined!

The ScurvyDogs Unofficial Pack is a **multiplayer-focused adventure/RPG modpack** built around our small community. While designed for online play, it also offers a rewarding single-player experience.

## 🔥 Key Features

#### 🛠️ Community Focused

*   Dedicated server home-hosted for the community and open to the public, with faction wars and co-op encouraged! Bring up some friends and write a story, we're all happy to indulge!

#### ⚔️ RPG-like Progression System

*   Origins & Skills redefine how you level up—advancements take a backseat to RPG-style skill progression. Start fighting for your life as you collect skill points and advance your magic power!

#### 🏗️ The Factory Must Grow!

*   Create-powered automation, bringing mechanical ingenuity to Minecraft with expansive Create addons. Build large machines to farm mobs or even just a few carrots! Whether big or small, the community always appreciates a new entrepreneur!

#### 🏰 Exploration & Structures

*   With **dozens** of new structures to explore, from mysterious ruins to fortified airships, to new dungeons with unique loot and challenges, all **hand-picked** to enhance your experience!

#### 🔮 Magic & Spells

*   Using Iron’s Spellbooks & Addons bring a rich spellcasting system, enabling you to unlock powerful magic as you progress and customize your playstyle. Will you shoot ice beams and freeze enemies? Teleport behind them and do heavy backstabbing damage? The choice is yours!

#### 🚀 Work in Progress

*   Custom KubeJS scripts for balancing mechanics, always open to feedback and improvement. Expect occasional bugs & compatibility issues—feedback is welcome! We're constantly updating to bring our community the best experience possible, and community feedback is essential to our further development!
